## Style Guide for Git Commit Messages :memo:

**How you can add more value to your contribution logs:**

-   Use the present tense. (Example: "Add feature" instead of "Added feature")
-   Use the imperative mood. (Example: "Move item to...", instead of "Moves item to...")
-   Limit the first line (also called the Subject Line) to _50 characters or fewer_.
-   Capitalize the Subject Line.
-   Separate subject from body with a blank line.
-   Do not end the subject line with a period.
-   Wrap the body at _72 characters_.
-   Use the body to explain the _what_, _why_, _vs_, and _how_.
-   Reference [Issues](https://github.com/thecyberworld/TheCyberHUB/issues) and [Pull Requests](https://github.com/thecyberworld/TheCyberHUB/pulls) liberally after the first line.
